# Getting Started this the sophisticated garage system!
In this project you can find a garage system that allows you to add and remove cars in your garage.
Once all the garages are full it will ask you if you want to buy a new garage.
When you have a bought a new garage you can add more cars!! crazy right :3!!
You make only purchace a new garage once all the current ones are full, so Make sure all Garages are full in order to buy a new Garage.

Insall the dependencies:
npm install

Then run the app:
npm start

Disclamer: This project is all fake, you don't actually buy garages or cars unfortunately ;-; Big sad :sadEmoji:
